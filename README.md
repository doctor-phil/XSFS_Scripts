# Installing the Virtual Machine for ztree-unleashed

First, ensure that you have downloaded and installed the latest versions of:
1. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
2. [The FSU VPN client](https://vpn.fsu.edu) (if applicable)

Follow the instructions [here](https://cler1.gitlab.io/ztree-unleashed-doc/docs/installation/) to download and install the ztree-unleashed virtual machine image. If applicable, use the host/domain name: xsfs.coss.fsu.edu


# XSFS_Scripts

This code builds off of the ztree-unleashed platform developed by researchers at the Cologne Laboratory for Economic Research.
Please visit the [ztree-unleashed documentation](https://cler1.gitlab.io/ztree-unleashed-doc/docs/installation/) for more information about ztree-unleashed.
Also, remember to cite their paper in the Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance if you use ztree-unleashed.

This folder MUST be placed on the desktop!

This code will set up a bunch of scripts for using the XS/FS server.

To use, first double click on the launcher called:
XS/FS ONE-TIME-SETUP

When prompted, enter your username for the server and
the domain of the server.

If you want, you can run the OPENSSH ONE-TIME SETUP launcher
This will create a secure SSH key for this VM on the server so
you don't need a password to log in each time. 

It is recommended but not required.
Also, remember to change the port number
(NOTE: we no longer need to modify the ports in generate_session.py)

The important launchers are "PRE-SESSION" and "POST-SESSION"
These can be found on the desktop after installation

To run an experiment on the server, follow these steps IN ORDER:
1. Run "PRE-SESSION"
2. Run "Start session" and follow the instructions
3. Log in to [the singlelink utility](https://xsfs.coss.fsu.edu/go)
4. Start a new session in singlelink, using the links generated by ztree-unleashed. The title you choose for the session will be used in the URL that is given to subjects.
5. Distribute the URL to subjects in the form: https://xsfs.coss.fsu.edu/go/YOURSESSIONTITLE


WHEN YOU ARE DONE:
1. Run "Terminate session". When prompted, type YES to confirm
2. Run "POST-SESSION"
